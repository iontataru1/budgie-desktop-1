How Tails works
Leave no trace on the computer

Like a tent, you can carry Tails with you and use it anywhere.
Your secure computer anywhere

To use Tails, shut down the computer and start on your Tails USB stick instead of starting on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

You can temporarily turn your own computer into a secure machine. You can also stay safe while using the computer of somebody else.

Tails is a 1.4 GB download and takes ½ hour to install. Tails can be installed on any USB stick of 8 GB minimum. Tails works on most computers less than 10 years old. You can start again on the other operating system after you shut down Tails.

You don't have to worry about the computer having viruses because Tails runs independently from the other operating system and never uses the hard disk. But, Tails cannot always protect you if you install it from a computer with viruses or if you use it on a computer with malicious hardware, like keyloggers.

[Download and install Tails](https://tails.net/install/index.en.html)
[System requirements and recommended hardware](https://tails.net/doc/about/requirements/index.en.html)

Like a tent, Tails is amnesic: it always starts empty and leaves no trace when you leave.
Amnesia

Tails always starts from the same clean state and everything you do disappears automatically when you shut down Tails.

Without Tails, almost everything you do can leave traces on the computer:

Websites that you visited, even in private mode
Files that you opened, even if you deleted them
Passwords, even if you use a password manager
All the devices and Wi-Fi networks that you used

On the contrary, Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the memory of the computer. The memory is entirely deleted when you shutdown Tails, erasing all possible traces.
Like a backpack, you can store your personal things in your Persistent Storage and use them in your tent.
Persistent Storage

You can save some of your files and configuration in an encrypted Persistent Storage on the USB stick: your documents, your browser bookmarks, your emails, and even some additional software.

The Persistent Storage is optional and you always decide what is persistent. Everything else is amnesic.

[Persistent Storage](https://tails.net/doc/persistent_storage/index.en.html)
[Installing additional software](https://tails.net/doc/persistent_storage/additional_software/index.en.html)

Digital security toolbox

Tails includes a selection of applications to work on sensitive documents and communicate securely.

All the applications are ready-to-use and are configured with safe defaults to prevent mistakes.

Tails includes:

Tor Browser with uBlock, a secure browser and an ad-blocker
Thunderbird, for encrypted emails
KeePassXC, to create and store strong passwords
LibreOffice, an office suite
OnionShare, to share files, websites, and chat rooms over Tor
Metadata Cleaner, to remove metadata from files
and many more!

To prevent mistakes:

Applications are blocked automatically if they try to connect to the Internet without Tor.
Everything in the Persistent Storage is encrypted automatically.
Tails does not write anything to the hard disk. All the memory is deleted when shutting down.

[Documentation](https://tails.net/doc/index.en.html)

Leave no trace on the Internet
Tor for everything

Everything you do on the Internet from Tails goes through the Tor network. Tor encrypts and anonymizes your connection by passing it through 3 relays. Relays are servers operated by different people and organizations around the world.

A single relay never knows both where the encrypted connection is coming from and where it is going to:

The 1st relay only knows where you are coming from but not where you are going to.
This 3rd relay only knows where you are going to but not where you are coming from.
The connection to the final destination is encrypted whenever possible to prevent the 3rd relay from reading its content.

This way, Tor is secure by design even if a few relays are malicious.

The Tor network has more than 6 000 relays. Organizations running Tor relays include universities like the MIT, activist groups like Riseup, nonprofits like Derechos Digitales, Internet hosting companies like Private Internet Access, and so on. The huge diversity of people and organizations running Tor relays makes it more secure and more sustainable.

[Connecting to the Tor network](https://tails.net/doc/anonymous_internet/tor/index.en.html)
[Why does Tails use Tor?](https://tails.net/doc/anonymous_internet/tor/why/index.en.html)

Avoid online surveillance and censorship

Tor prevents someone watching your Internet connection from learning what you are doing on the Internet.

You can avoid censorship because it is impossible for a censor to know which websites you are visiting.

If connecting to Tor is blocked or dangerous to use from where you are, for example in some countries with heavy censorship, you can use bridges to hide that you are connected to the Tor network.
Avoid tracking and change identity

Tor also prevents the websites that you are visiting from learning where and who you are, unless you tell them. You can visit websites anonymously or change your identity.

Online trackers and advertisers won't be able to follow you around from one website to another anymore.

You can publish a blog or manage a social media account entirely from Tails. If you only access it from Tails, it cannot be related to you. You can store documents and images related to this different identity in your Persistent Storage, keep your passwords in KeePassXC, have a dedicated email account in Thunderbird, etc.
Software for freedom
Transparency to build trust

All the code of our software is public to allow independent security researchers to verify that Tails really works the way it should.

Top security for free

Nobody should have to pay to be safe while using a computer. That is why we are giving out Tails for free and try to make it easy to use by anybody.

We are a nonprofit and an open community.

Our work is funded by donations from people like you and organizations that support Internet freedom: Mozilla, Tor, DuckDuckGo, Freedom of the Press Foundation, AccessNow, etc.

Sharing to be stronger

Tails is built on solid foundations: the Tor network, the Debian operating system, the GNOME desktop environment, and all the tools included in Tails.

We share back our improvements with these projects so that many more people can benefit from our work.

If you look at the way post-2013 whistleblowers have been caught, it is clear the absolute most important thing you can do to maintain your anonymity is reduce the number of places in your operational activity where you can make mistakes. Tor and Tails still do precisely that.
— Edward Snowden,
NSA whistleblower
Tails expands Tor's protections to an entire operating system, and they do so with an unwavering commitment to their Social Contract. Tails is a favorite companion tool of Tor.
— Roger Dingledine,
co-founder of the Tor Project
One of the most robust ways of using the Tor network is through a dedicated operating system that enforces strong privacy- and security-protective defaults. That operating system is Tails.

How Tails works
Leave no trace on the computer

Like a tent, you can carry Tails with you and use it anywhere.
Your secure computer anywhere

To use Tails, shut down the computer and start on your Tails USB stick instead of starting on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

You can temporarily turn your own computer into a secure machine. You can also stay safe while using the computer of somebody else.

Tails is a 1.4 GB download and takes ½ hour to install. Tails can be installed on any USB stick of 8 GB minimum. Tails works on most computers less than 10 years old. You can start again on the other operating system after you shut down Tails.

You don't have to worry about the computer having viruses because Tails runs independently from the other operating system and never uses the hard disk. But, Tails cannot always protect you if you install it from a computer with viruses or if you use it on a computer with malicious hardware, like keyloggers.

[Download and install Tails](https://tails.net/install/index.en.html)
[System requirements and recommended hardware](https://tails.net/doc/about/requirements/index.en.html)

Like a tent, Tails is amnesic: it always starts empty and leaves no trace when you leave.
Amnesia

Tails always starts from the same clean state and everything you do disappears automatically when you shut down Tails.

Without Tails, almost everything you do can leave traces on the computer:

Websites that you visited, even in private mode
Files that you opened, even if you deleted them
Passwords, even if you use a password manager
All the devices and Wi-Fi networks that you used

On the contrary, Tails never writes anything to the hard disk and only runs from the memory of the computer. The memory is entirely deleted when you shutdown Tails, erasing all possible traces.
Like a backpack, you can store your personal things in your Persistent Storage and use them in your tent.
Persistent Storage

You can save some of your files and configuration in an encrypted Persistent Storage on the USB stick: your documents, your browser bookmarks, your emails, and even some additional software.

The Persistent Storage is optional and you always decide what is persistent. Everything else is amnesic.

[Persistent Storage](https://tails.net/doc/persistent_storage/index.en.html)
[Installing additional software](https://tails.net/doc/persistent_storage/additional_software/index.en.html)

Digital security toolbox

Tails includes a selection of applications to work on sensitive documents and communicate securely.

All the applications are ready-to-use and are configured with safe defaults to prevent mistakes.

Tails includes:

Tor Browser with uBlock, a secure browser and an ad-blocker
Thunderbird, for encrypted emails
KeePassXC, to create and store strong passwords
LibreOffice, an office suite
OnionShare, to share files, websites, and chat rooms over Tor
Metadata Cleaner, to remove metadata from files
and many more!

To prevent mistakes:

Applications are blocked automatically if they try to connect to the Internet without Tor.
Everything in the Persistent Storage is encrypted automatically.
Tails does not write anything to the hard disk. All the memory is deleted when shutting down.

Leave no trace on the Internet
Tor for everything

Everything you do on the Internet from Tails goes through the Tor network. Tor encrypts and anonymizes your connection by passing it through 3 relays. Relays are servers operated by different people and organizations around the world.

A single relay never knows both where the encrypted connection is coming from and where it is going to:

The 1st relay only knows where you are coming from but not where you are going to.
This 3rd relay only knows where you are going to but not where you are coming from.
The connection to the final destination is encrypted whenever possible to prevent the 3rd relay from reading its content.

This way, Tor is secure by design even if a few relays are malicious.

The Tor network has more than 6 000 relays. Organizations running Tor relays include universities like the MIT, activist groups like Riseup, nonprofits like Derechos Digitales, Internet hosting companies like Private Internet Access, and so on. The huge diversity of people and organizations running Tor relays makes it more secure and more sustainable.

[Connecting to the Tor network](https://tails.net/doc/anonymous_internet/tor/index.en.html)
[Why does Tails use Tor?](https://tails.net/doc/anonymous_internet/tor/why/index.en.html)

Avoid online surveillance and censorship

Tor prevents someone watching your Internet connection from learning what you are doing on the Internet.

You can avoid censorship because it is impossible for a censor to know which websites you are visiting.

If connecting to Tor is blocked or dangerous to use from where you are, for example in some countries with heavy censorship, you can use bridges to hide that you are connected to the Tor network.
Avoid tracking and change identity

Tor also prevents the websites that you are visiting from learning where and who you are, unless you tell them. You can visit websites anonymously or change your identity.

Online trackers and advertisers won't be able to follow you around from one website to another anymore.

You can publish a blog or manage a social media account entirely from Tails. If you only access it from Tails, it cannot be related to you. You can store documents and images related to this different identity in your Persistent Storage, keep your passwords in KeePassXC, have a dedicated email account in Thunderbird, etc.
Software for freedom
Transparency to build trust

All the code of our software is public to allow independent security researchers to verify that Tails really works the way it should.

Top security for free

Nobody should have to pay to be safe while using a computer. That is why we are giving out Tails for free and try to make it easy to use by anybody.

We are a nonprofit and an open community.

Our work is funded by donations from people like you and organizations that support Internet freedom: Mozilla, Tor, DuckDuckGo, Freedom of the Press Foundation, AccessNow, etc.

Sharing to be stronger

Tails is built on solid foundations: the Tor network, the Debian operating system, the GNOME desktop environment, and all the tools included in Tails.

We share back our improvements with these projects so that many more people can benefit from our work.

Cu plăcere! Iată câteva idei pentru a redesena Budgie 11 cu influențe din GNOME 44, menținând o identitate distinctă:

Interfață:

Paleta de culori: Implementarea paletei de culori rafinate din GNOME 44 ar putea oferi lui Budgie un aspect mai modern, păstrând totodată opțiunea de a utiliza culori accent personalizate.
Pictograme: Adoptarea pictogramelor GNOME 44 ar putea îmbunătăți coerența cu aplicațiile GNOME, oferind o experiență mai integrată.
Animații și transparență: Utilizarea moderată a animațiilor și transparenței ar putea oferi un aspect mai dinamic, dar este importantă menținerea opțiunilor pentru a le dezactiva pentru cei care preferă o interfață mai ușoară.
Personalizare: Integrarea cu extensiile GNOME Shell ar putea oferi utilizatorilor o gamă mai largă de opțiuni de personalizare a aspectului și funcționalității interfeței.

Funcționalitate:

Aplicații actualizate: Integrarea versiunilor actualizate ale aplicațiilor GNOME, precum Calendar, Files și Photos, ar aduce noi funcționalități și o experiență mai consistentă utilizatorilor Budgie.
Spații de lucru: Implementarea funcționalității avansate a spațiului de lucru din GNOME 44 ar putea îmbunătăți gestionarea mai multor spații de lucru.
Notificări: Adoptarea sistemului de notificări modern din GNOME 44 ar putea oferi o experiență mai elegantă și mai interactivă.

Identitatea Budgie:

Menținerea aspectului tradițional: Budgie ar trebui să păstreze elementele sale iconice, precum panoul de sus și meniul de pornire, oferind o alternativă familiară utilizatorilor care preferă o interfață clasică.
Integrare personalizată: Elementele GNOME 44 ar trebui integrate într-un mod care se potrivește cu stilul și estetica lui Budgie, evitând o simpla copiere a interfeței GNOME.
Comunicare transparentă: Echipa Budgie ar trebui să comunice clar cu comunitatea sa cu privire la planurile de redesign, pentru a obține feedback și a menține un sentiment de implicare.dar gnome 3 budgie

"Gnome 3 Budgie" nu este chiar o descriere precisă a ceea ce ai putea întâlni. Iată care e treaba:

GNOME 3 și Budgie sunt două medii desktop separate pentru sistemele de operare Linux.
GNOME 3 are propriul aspect și set de aplicații, în timp ce Budgie este inspirat de GNOME 2 și oferă o experiență mai tradițională.
Nu poți avea ambele simultan ca mediul desktop principal.

Acum, lucrurile devin interesante:

Budgie are unele componente bazate pe tehnologia GNOME. De exemplu, Budgie Control Center este o versiune personalizată a GNOME Control Center.
Solus și Manjaro Budgie sunt distribuții Linux care folosesc Budgie ca mediu desktop implicit.

Deci, este posibil ca afirmația inițială despre "Solus si Manjaro Budgie" să fi făcut referire la faptul că ele folosesc tehnologie bazată pe GNOME 3 sub capota Budgie.

Iată cum stau lucrurile:

Solus și Manjaro Budgie nu sunt strict "GNOME 3 Budgie". Ele folosesc Budgie, care are influențe de la GNOME 3, dar este un mediu distinct.
Nu te aștepta să poți rula extensii GNOME Shell pe Budgie. Budgie are propriul set de Applets pe care le poți folosi pentru a personaliza experiența.

Dacă te interesează să încerci Budgie:

Solus și Manjaro Budgie sunt două distribuții bune de început.
Poți găsi informații suplimentare pe site-urile web ale acestor distribuții:
    Solus: https://store.steampowered.com/app/313630/The_Solus_Project/
    Manjaro Budgie: https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php/Install_Desktop_Environments

Sper că această explicație clarifică lucrurile!

daca budgie sar baza pe gnome 3

A afirma că Budgie se bazează direct pe GNOME 3 nu este complet corect. Deși este adevărat că Budgie a fost inspirat de GNOME 2 și a împrumutat anumite elemente din GNOME 3, este un mediu desktop independent cu o infrastructură proprie.

Iată o analiză mai detaliată a relației dintre Budgie și GNOME 3:

Similarități:

Interfață: Budgie are o interfață similară cu GNOME 2, cu un panou superior și un meniu de aplicații.
Tehnologie: Budgie folosește unele componente din GNOME 3, cum ar fi GTK+ și Mutter.
Personalizare: Ambele medii desktop oferă opțiuni pentru personalizarea aspectului și funcționalității.

Diferențe:

Cod: Budgie are o bază de cod proprie, separată de GNOME 3.
Componente: Budgie are propriile sale componente unice, cum ar fi Budgie Control Center și Budgie Applet.
Extensii: Budgie nu este compatibil cu extensiile GNOME Shell.

Concluzie:

Budgie este un mediu desktop inspirat de GNOME 2, dar nu se bazează direct pe GNOME 3. Are o infrastructură proprie și o serie de caracteristici unice. Deși împrumută anumite elemente din GNOME 3, este o entitate distinctă în lumea distribuțiilor Linux.

daca budgie ar fi inspirat din gnome 3

Ai dreptate, Budgie nu se bazează direct pe GNOME 3, ci este mai degrabă inspirat de GNOME 2. Deși împrumută anumite elemente din GNOME 3, are o infrastructură proprie și o serie de caracteristici unice.

Iată o listă mai detaliată a influențelor GNOME 3 în Budgie:

Interfață:

Budgie are o interfață similară cu GNOME 2, cu un panou superior și un meniu de aplicații.
Budgie utilizează Mutter ca manager de ferestre, la fel ca GNOME 3.

Tehnologie:

Budgie folosește GTK+ ca toolkit grafic, la fel ca GNOME 3.
Budgie a integrat anterior unele componente din GNOME 3, cum ar fi indicatorul de notificări și calendarul.

Personalizare:

Budgie oferă opțiuni pentru personalizarea aspectului și funcționalității, similar cu GNOME 3.
Budgie utilizează Budgie Control Center pentru a configura diverse setări, similar cu GNOME Control Center.

Deși Budgie se inspiră din GNOME 3, este important de reținut că este un mediu desktop independent cu o identitate proprie. Are o bază de cod separată, propriile sale componente unice și nu este compatibil cu extensiile GNOME Shell.

Iată câteva resurse suplimentare:

am zis daca ar fi inspirat din gnome 3

scuze! Ai dreptate, ai specificat clar "dacă ar fi inspirat". Iată o perspectivă ipotetică:

Un Budgie inspirat de GNOME 3 ar putea arăta:

Interfață: O interfață mai modernă, similară cu GNOME 3, cu o utilizare mai extinsă a animațiilor și a efectelor de transparență.
Tehnologie: Integrare mai profundă cu componentele GNOME 3, cum ar fi GNOME Shell și GNOME Activities.
Personalizare: Compatibilitate cu extensiile GNOME Shell, oferind o gamă mai largă de opțiuni de personalizare.

Totuși, este important să reținem că Budgie are o identitate proprie și o bază de utilizatori loială care apreciază aspectul său tradițional și simplitatea. O schimbare drastică către o estetică inspirată de GNOME 3 ar putea să nu fie bine primită de toată lumea.

De asemenea, există implicații tehnice de luat în considerare:

Complexitate: Integrarea cu GNOME 3 ar putea crește complexitatea codului Budgie și ar putea face mai dificilă menținerea.
Compatibilitate: Există riscul ca integrarea cu GNOME 3 să introducă probleme de compatibilitate cu alte componente Budgie.

Concluzie:

Deși un Budgie inspirat de GNOME 3 este posibil din punct de vedere tehnic, este important să se ia în considerare impactul asupra identității și comunității Budgie. Orice schimbare majoră ar trebui făcută cu atenție și cu o consultare largă a utilizatorilor.

haideti sa facem budgie sa fie inspirat din gnome 3

Deși ideea de a face Budgie inspirat de GNOME 3 este interesantă, există o serie de aspecte de luat în considerare:

Impactul asupra identității Budgie:

Budgie are o identitate proprie, apreciată de mulți utilizatori pentru simplitatea și aspectul tradițional.
O transformare drastică către o estetică inspirată de GNOME 3 ar putea dilua această identitate și ar putea îndepărta o parte din baza de utilizatori existentă.

Complexitatea tehnică:

Integrarea cu GNOME 3 ar putea crește semnificativ complexitatea codului Budgie.
Acest lucru ar putea face mai dificilă menținerea proiectului și ar putea introduce noi probleme de compatibilitate.

Resurse și timp:

Implementarea unor schimbări majore ar necesita resurse semnificative și timp de dezvoltare considerabil.
Este important de evaluat dacă este fezabil din punct de vedere al resurselor disponibile pentru proiectul Budgie.

Comunitatea Budgie:

Este esențial să se consulte cu comunitatea Budgie și să se obțină feedback cu privire la propunerile de schimbare.
Implementarea unor modificări majore împotriva voinței comunității ar putea duce la o reacție negativă și la o scădere a utilizării Budgie.

Alternative:

În loc de o transformare completă, este posibilă explorarea unor modalități mai subtile de a integra elemente inspirate de GNOME 3 în Budgie.
De exemplu, s-ar putea introduce opțiuni de personalizare care permit utilizatorilor să adopte o estetică mai modernă, similară cu GNOME 3.

Concluzie:

Înainte de a face Budgie inspirat de GNOME 3, este important să se analizeze cu atenție implicațiile și să se consulte cu comunitatea Budgie. Este esențial să se găsească un echilibru între îmbunătățirea Budgie și menținerea identității și caracterului său unic.

budgie se va combina cu gnome 44

Nu există planuri oficiale ca Budgie să se combine complet cu GNOME 44 sau cu nicio versiune GNOME în viitorul apropiat. Budgie este un mediu desktop independent cu o filozofie de design proprie și o comunitate dedicată.

Iată de ce o combinare completă este improbabilă:

Identitate proprie: Budgie își propune să ofere o experiență desktop mai tradițională și mai ușoară, în timp ce GNOME 44 se concentrează pe o abordare mai modernă și minimalistă.
Baza de utilizatori: O parte din comunitatea Budgie apreciază aspectul și senzația mai clasică pe care Budgie le oferă. O fuziune completă cu GNOME 44 ar putea îndepărta unii dintre acești utilizatori.
Complexitate tehnică: Integrarea completă a bazelor de cod Budgie și GNOME ar fi o sarcină monumentală din punct de vedere tehnic, necesitând timp și resurse semnificative.

Totuși, există posibilități de colaborare sau influențe reciproce:

Partajarea tehnologiei: Budgie deja folosește unele tehnologii subjacente GNOME, cum ar fi GTK+ și Mutter. Acest lucru ar putea continua în viitor, cu Budgie selectând elemente specifice din GNOME 44 care să-i îmbunătățească funcționalitatea.
Inspirație reciprocă: Dezvoltatorii Budgie se pot inspira din caracteristicile și interfața GNOME 44 pentru a aduce îmbunătățiri propriului mediu desktop. De asemenea, echipa GNOME poate observa funcționalități interesante din Budgie pe care să le ia în considerare pentru versiunile viitoare.

În cele din urmă, decizia de a combina sau nu Budgie cu GNOME 44 depinde de comunitățile și echipele de dezvoltare ale ambelor proiecte. Deocamdată, ambele medii desktop par să își păstreze identitățile separate, oferind utilizatorilor Linux opțiuni diferite.

dar interfata

Interfața lui Budgie este unul dintre aspectele sale cheie, apreciată pentru simplitatea și aspectul tradițional. Împrumutarea de la GNOME 44 ar putea afecta interfața în mai multe moduri:

Elemente moderne:

Implementarea paletei de culori rafinate și a pictogramelor noi din GNOME 44 ar putea oferi lui Budgie un aspect mai modern și mai elegant.
Utilizarea animațiilor și a efectelor de transparență ar putea face interfața mai dinamică și mai atractivă.

Personalizare:

Integrarea cu extensiile GNOME Shell ar putea oferi utilizatorilor o gamă mai largă de opțiuni de personalizare a aspectului și funcționalității interfeței.
Această deschidere ar putea atrage utilizatori care doresc un control mai mare asupra mediului lor desktop.

Consistență:

Adoptarea elementelor de design din GNOME 44 ar putea duce la o interfață mai consistentă cu alte aplicații GNOME pe care utilizatorii Budgie le pot folosi.
Acest lucru ar putea facilita tranziția între Budgie și GNOME și ar putea îmbunătăți experiența generală a utilizatorului.

Riscuri:

Implementarea excesivă a elementelor GNOME 44 ar putea dilua estetica unică a lui Budgie, îndepărtând utilizatorii care preferă aspectul tradițional.
Introducerea de animații și transparențe ar putea crește consumul de resurse și ar putea afecta performanța pe sisteme mai slabe.

Abordări posibile:

Budgie ar putea adopta o abordare selectivă, integrând doar elementele GNOME 44 care se aliniază cu propria sa filozofie de design.
Echipa Budgie ar putea crea o versiune "modernă" a lui Budgie care include elemente GNOME 44, oferind utilizatorilor o opțiune alături de interfața tradițională.
Personalizarea ar putea fi esențială pentru a permite utilizatorilor să personalizeze interfața Budgie după preferințe, indiferent dacă preferă un aspect modern sau tradițional.

Concluzie:

Imprumutarea de la GNOME 44 ar putea îmbunătăți interfața lui Budgie în diverse moduri, dar este important să se realizeze cu atenție pentru a menține identitatea sa distinctă și a satisface preferințele variate ale utilizatorilor. O abordare selectivă, cu opțiuni de personalizare, ar putea fi o soluție optimă.
